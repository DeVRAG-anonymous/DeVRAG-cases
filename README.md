# DeVRAG-cases
This project presents the results of the manual case analysis of LMM-DVC.
***
## cases.json
This file provides 50 cases and their manual analysis results. Each case includes captions generated with and without DeVRAG, along with the consistency level between the generated captions and the ground truth labels. Specifically, this file contains a list. Each element in the list provides information about a case. 

An example of the case is as follows:

```json
{
    "Video ID": "JxCBGlPgr5o",
    "Video link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxCBGlPgr5o",
    "Event time": [238, 244],
    "Caption generated by 'without DeVRAG'": "place the cheese on top of the meat",
    "Caption generated by DeVRAG": "place the cheese and bacon on top of the patties",
    "Ground truth": "place the cheese and bacon on top of the patties",
    "Consistency level of 'without DeVRAG'": "partially consistent", # entirely consistent | mostly consistent | partially consistent | inconsistent
    "Consistency level of DeVRAG": "entirely consistent"  # entirely consistent | mostly consistent | partially consistent | inconsistent
}
```
<!-- - **Video ID:** the name of the video
- **Video link:** the link to the video
- **Event time:** the start and end time of the event in the video
- **Caption generated by "without DeVRAG":** the caption generated without DeVRAG for the event
- **Caption generated by DeVRAG** refers to the caption generated with DeVRAG for the event
- **Ground truth:** the caption label for this event in the video
- **Consistency level of "without DeVRAG":** the consistency level between the caption generated without DeVRAG and the ground truth
- **Consistency level of DeVRAG:** the consistency level between the caption generated with DeVRAG and the ground truth -->
  
The detailed information of the element structure is as follows:

|Key|Description|
|---|---|
|**Video ID**| The name of the video|
|**Video link**| The link to the video|
|**Event time:**| The start and end time of the event in the video|
| **Caption generated by "without DeVRAG"**| The caption generated without DeVRAG for the event|
| **Caption generated by DeVRAG**| The caption generated with DeVRAG for the event|
| **Ground truth**| The caption label for this event in the video|
| **Consistency level of "without DeVRAG"**| The consistency level between the caption generated without DeVRAG and the ground truth|
| **Consistency level of DeVRAG**| The consistency level between the caption generated with DeVRAG and the ground truth|
